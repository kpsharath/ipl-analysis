# IPL Analysis and Match Prediction

The Indian Premier League is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during April and May of every year 
by franchise teams representing Indian cities. IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all sports leagues.


So we are aiming to build a system which would do a predictive analysis of IPL 2016 using the existing player data sets in the preceding year, 
2015. Storing and channelizing that data correctly using the fast emerging techniques of Big data, at the end we aim to predict 
and simulate a match of IPL 2016 successfully as far as possible.
